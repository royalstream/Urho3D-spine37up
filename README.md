# Runtime files and Sample for Urho3D and Spine 3.7+

This repo contains the **spine-c** folder taken from here https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes with no code changes. The **spineboy** example was also included. Since this repository has different branches for different runtime versions and they're not backwards-compatible, we followed the same approach. At the time of writing there are two branches: 3.7 and 3.8 branch. 

We also created a new project in Urho3D's Samples folder called **33_Urho2DSpineAnimation** which is **33_Urho2DSpriterAnimation** with some minor changes to use Spine instead of Spriter. The code for this example is the same for all branches.

# Installation

1. Copy on top of your Urho3D installation. It should not overwrite any files.
2. Rerun build scripts / cmake
3. Rebuild project
